TODO:

* Connect all this to Git somehow...
* Fix texture tiling for the custom shader
* Enable directly jumping from the wall jump wall (partially complete, needs air testing and tinkering with or replacing the third person controller to allow air control?)
* Code a "target dummy"
* Write or import custom camera
* Code dash interaction with enemies
* Code cooldown system?
* Code another ability (e.g. "gatestone")?
* Playtest? 
* Design levels?
* figure out how to get art assets into the game
* figure out how to get animator
* think about level theme
- * I feel like a nature aesthetic would be an interesting contrast (and hey, it's an homage to Ori and Sanic, two of the games that inspired this.)
- * assassin's creed aesthetic works too.
* moar stuff

NEEDS TESTING/DEBUGGING:

* Wall jump wall

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:

* Add camera controls somehow (would like to update with more precise camera controls controlled with a different mouse button.)

COMPLETE: 

* Start project. Done!
* Blink working. Done!
* Other stuff from before I started this list: Done!
* Write shader for 3D range display on interactable areas. Done!
* Blink particles in correct direction: Done!


Overall, this seems like an oddly effective way to show off what I can do...shaders, Unity, and design all at once...
