# BlinkWarp

BlinkWarp is a Unity game where the player controls a character that can blink onto certain surfaces by clicking on them.

I am currently still working on building everything. At the moment I have a "sandbox" level to test what I have so far.

This is the first time I've personally set up version control for a Unity project--if you see any major issues/red flags in the repo, please let me know.
